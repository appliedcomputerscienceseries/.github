# Applied Computer Science Invited Speaker Series

In applied computer science new programming languages and paradigms, like Rust and Julia, new architectures, like Arm and RISC-V, and new GPU’s, like NVidia’s Grace Hopper, AMD's MI300A or Intel Max, are emerging. To keep on top of these advances, the Advances in Applied Computer Science series will invite speakers from academia, industry, and other national labs. This will allow researchers and code developers to learn about these new tools and technologies and integrate them into codes to prepare them for future hardware and software or hardware.
